How to run the application from command line:
**java Driver**

----------------------------

Description:

This program will print out work order dependencies based on files for the work orders and their respective dependencies with the file paths modified in the code since input of file paths are not in Software requirements.

The files must be text files and follow a format of "*ID Number*, *Order Name*" for the work orders file and "*ID Number*,*ID Number of Dependency*" for the dependency file otherwise the program will not work (the commas between are also important).

After the program has run a new file called **"output.txt"** will be created inside the Java folder that will show only the dependencies and sub-dependencies (if any) of the work order - the file will not show the order in which to do work orders.
